text = "The first cholera pandemic, also known as Asiatic cholera, began in 1817. It started in India and extended to Nepal, Indonesia, China, Japan, the Middle East, and parts of Russia. It was followed by six other pandemics, which happened in the period between 1827 to 1923 and spread to different continents, including Europe and the United States. The first six pandemics were transmitted by the classical biotype of Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1 through contaminated water. The seventh cholera pandemic, which is still ongoing, began in 1961. It started in Indonesia and spread to more continents and countries than the previous six pandemics, then became endemic in several world regions. It is transmitted by El Tor biotype strain of Vibrio cholerae through contaminated water and is still causing outbreaks across the world, the last of which happened in Somalia in March 2021. It is approximated that the first six cholera pandemics claimed about 1 million lives. The seventh cholera pandemic is estimated to cause around 2.86 million cholera cases globally every year, and of them, approximately 95,000 die every year. About 1.3 billion people are currently at risk of infection from cholera."
